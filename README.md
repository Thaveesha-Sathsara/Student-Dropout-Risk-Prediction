### ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Risk Prediction
## Hackathon Project | Built with Python + Streamlit

This is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a university student dropping out, based on their academic performance, family background, and other factors.

We used a dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository and applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a Random Forest classifier to make predictions. The model outputs a value between 0 and 1, where:

0 = Likely to stay

1 = High dropout risk

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python for development

Pandas & NumPy for data processing

Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations

Scikit-learn for ML model building

Streamlit for deploying the app

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features
Real-time risk prediction from student data

Clean and user-friendly Streamlit interface

Visual insights into key dropout factors

Lightweight and easy to deploy

## ðŸš€ Hackathon Challenge
We built this as a team project within just 4 hours during a hackathon. One of the biggest challenges was cleaning and preparing the data quickly, then designing and deploying the entire pipeline in time. Lots of last-minute debugging and creative problem-solving involved, but we made it work!
